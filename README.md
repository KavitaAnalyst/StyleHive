1) Connected the project with github repository .
2) installed react-router-dom read blog for furter understanding.
3) created three fo0lders inside 'src' 
  a) Components folder : for creating reusable components.
  b) Pages: for multiple pages 
  c) Context for context APIs

4) created assets forlder to upload the images and the json file for dynamic data display.
5) imported logo and cart images from the assets folder.
6) used <hr/> for heighliting the active page.
7) used "useState" hook to create a state to check the change in the states of the different menu items in navbar , if home page will be active then the underlline will appear on home link.
8) now the compoents are resuable and we will need them in different pages like home page, product page etc so we will need to "import Browser Router" from react-router-dom libary in app.js
9)
